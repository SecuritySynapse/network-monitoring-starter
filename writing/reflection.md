# Networking Monitoring

## Add Your Name Here

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

TODO: You must retype the sentence here in order to digitally sign your pledge.

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

## Program Output

TODO: Please provide a fenced code block for the output of the tool that
demonstrates the program running in each of the following modes:

- **Modes**:
- **Client and Server Protocols**:
  - _Server Socket_: Start a server using sockets.
  - _Client Socket_: Start a client using sockets.
  - _Server XML-RPC_: Start a server using XML-RPC.
  - _Client XML-RPC_: Start a client using XML-RPC.
- **Interception Mechanisms**:
  - _Intercept Socket_: Intercept network communication that uses sockets.
  - _Intercept XML-RPC_: Intercept network communication that uses XML-RPC.

TODO: Make sure that when you provide the output for the, for instance,
XML-RPC-based client it is when you have previously run the XML-RPC-based
server. You also need to make sure that you provide output from capturing the
socket-based and XML-RPC-based network traffic for both of these communication
modes. Please make sure that each fenced code block is correctly labelled.

TODO: Make sure to delete the `TODO` markers and use the reminders about the
various `mode`s of the `networkmonitor` tool to label the provided fenced code
blocks.

### Take Home Points

TODO: Provide a two to three sentence statement about the key takeaways from
conducting this experiment. Please note that the course instructor will display
some student takeaways on the course web site and use them to facilitate
follow-on discussions during the class and laboratory sessions.
